# Zachariah Redfield's Portfolio

## About Me
Hello! I'm Zac, a passionate game developer and software engineer currently expanding my skills in full-stack web development. I have a bachelor's degree in Game Development and I'm looking forward to showcasing my projects.

### Projects
- **Algorithmic Efficiency App**: A web app currently in development that focuses on algorithm efficiency and concurrency.
- **Portfolio**: This portfolio was entirely built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with Git for version control and Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE.
- **Mazer**: A procedurally generated 2D maze game built in C++ using Unreal Engine. Users can change maze size and camera scale. There are additional game features that can be toggled from the main menu options. An AI player navigates the maze using algorithms.
- **A Hard Pill to Swallow**: This wave-based shooter is similar to COD Zombies, but with a twist—the enemies shoot back! In this game, players explore the map by unlocking doors using keys and face off against enemies with various weapons, boosts, and tactical strategies. As part of the development team, I built levels, created game mechanics, designed the item drop system, and implemented a system for randomized loot spawns and interactable objects. The game also features dynamic elements like a load screen and randomized level resets with interactable objects for each new round.
