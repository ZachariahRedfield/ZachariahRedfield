# Zachariah Redfield's Portfolio

## About Me
Hello! I'm Zac, a Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in game development, software engineering, and data analysis. Proficient in C++, Java, Python, and full-stack web technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB. Demonstrated success in delivering impactful software solutions, optimizing processes, and contributing to disaster response efforts through data-driven decision-making. Eager to leverage problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and practical experience to contribute to innovative software projects..

## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio includes a selection of my projects, both in game development and web applications. Here’s what you can find:
- Visit my portfolio [here](https://zachariahredfield.github.io/ZachariahRedfield/) to see my projects
### Projects
- **Full-Stack Algorithm Efficiency Web App (Capstone)**: Currently developing a web application that demonstrates algorithm efficiency and performance analysis, using the MERN stack. This project serves as the capstone of my Full-Stack Software Engineering training, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies.
- **Website Portfolio**: An interactive and responsive portfolio website showcasing my projects as a Full-Stack Developer. Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js, it includes a contact form with MongoDB integration for storing submissions and features light/dark mode for accessibility.
- **AmeriCorps FEMA Corps - Data Analysis & GIS Support**: As a member of the AmeriCorps FEMA Corps, I supported disaster recovery efforts by developing over 50 dashboards using Excel and GIS data. I automated data analysis processes with Python, ArcGIS Pro and Excel, which improved operational efficiency by 20-30%. I consistently improved operational effiecency at each of the offices I was working with during my term of service.
- **Mazer**: A procedurally generated 2D maze game built in C++ using Unreal Engine. Users can change maze size and camera scale. There are additional game features that can be toggled from the main menu options. An AI player navigates the maze using algorithms.
- **Python GIS Data Analysis**: Developed a Python script using ArcGIS Pro to automate the conversion of .CSV data into a point table for mapping and analysis. This project played a crucial role in supporting disaster recovery efforts by enabling efficient visualization and analysis of geographic data. Enabled the Public Assistance cadre to more accurately identify and target communities or areas with fewer mapped data points, ensuring comprehensive assistance was provided to all affected regions.
- **Realm Blade**: This dynamic action game was developed as a capstone project in a team of five for my degree program. Players navigate a challenging fantasy world, facing off against enemies with varying difficulty levels. I contributed to the core game mechanics, level design, and enemy instantiation, optimizing the game for smooth transitions between levels and ensuring an engaging, seamless player experience.
- **A Hard Pill to Swallow**: This wave-based shooter is similar to COD Zombies, but with a twist—the enemies shoot back! In this game, players explore the map by unlocking doors using keys and face off against enemies with various weapons, boosts, and tactical strategies. As part of the development team, I built levels, created game mechanics, designed the item drop system, and implemented a system for randomized loot spawns and interactable objects. The game also features dynamic elements like a load screen and randomized level resets with interactable objects for each new round.
